# Validation status

What is known to work in game, where, and what has not been checked. One row
per feature, overwritten when a new result arrives. The evidence (builds,
hashes, traces, what the maintainer saw) is in
[VALIDATION-LOG.md](VALIDATION-LOG.md); search it by L-number instead of
reading it whole.

Baseline: Minecraft 1.26.51.01, LeviLamina Client 26.51.5, Windows x64.
"Local" is a single-player world, "BDS" a same-machine dedicated server
1.26.51.1. Results before the 26.51.5 update (commit 4a5b975) were re-checked
only briefly after it.

## Recording a result

Append an entry to the top of VALIDATION-LOG.md (date, commit, DLL SHA-256,
trace options, environment, what was done and seen, what was not covered),
then update the matching row here. Keep this file short: no hashes or traces,
only the date, environment and the open gaps. "Builds and tests pass" is not a
game result.
